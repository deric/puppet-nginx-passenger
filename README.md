## Puppet Nginx Module

This is a fork of [puppet-nginx](https://bitbucket.org/sgmac/puppet-nginx) to install nginx with
passenger using default ruby version on debian wheezy or ubuntu quantal.

This module installs Nginx using [puppet-rvm](https://github.com/blt04/puppet-rvm). Please, read the documentation before you begin. This module has been tested on Debian Squeeze 6.0.5. For custom types, do not forget to enable pluginsync: 
```
[main]
pluginsync = true

```

### Basic usage

Install nginx with

```
include nginx
```

By default installs on _/opt/nginx_, there are some variables you might override

```
$ruby_version      = 'ruby-1.9.3-p125'
$passenger_version = '3.0.12'
$installdir	   = '/opt/nginx'
$logdir		   = '/var/log/nginx'
$www		   = '/var/www'
```
A custom installation might look like this:

``` 
node webserver { 
    class { 'nginx':
      ruby_version      => 'ruby-1.9.3-p392',
      passenger_version => '3.0.19',
      www               => '/var/www',
      installdir        => '/usr/local/nginx',
   	  logdir            => '/usr/local/logs/nginx',
    }
}
```

### Virtual Hosts

You can easily configure a virtual hosts. An example is:

```
nginx::vhost { 'www.example.com':
	port  => '8080',
	rails => true,
  root  => '/var/www/example',
}
```
The _rails_ attribute is optional and set to false by default. However, if you want to deploy a rails app, use this attribute and the rails template will be used instead.
