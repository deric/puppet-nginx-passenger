## Puppet Nginx Module

This is a fork of [puppet-nginx](https://bitbucket.org/sgmac/puppet-nginx) to install [nginx](http://nginx.org/) with [passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) using default Ruby version. Nginx is fetched from nginx website and compiled with extra parameters you specify. 

### Requires

  - [puppet-rvm](https://github.com/blt04/puppet-rvm)
  - Puppet 2.6.17 (or higher)

Nginx is installed with usage of [puppet-rvm](https://github.com/blt04/puppet-rvm). Please, read the documentation before you begin. 

### Basic usage

Install nginx with

```
include nginx
```

or with parametrized class:

```
class { 'nginx': }
```

By default installs on _/opt/nginx_, there are some variables you might override

```
$ruby_version      = 'ruby-1.9.3-p392'
$passenger_version = '3.0.19'
$version           = '1.2.7'          # nginx version
$installdir	       = '/opt/nginx'
$logdir	           = '/var/log/nginx'
$www               = '/var/www'
```
A custom installation might look like this:

``` 
node webserver { 
    class { 'nginx':
      ruby_version      => 'ruby-1.9.3-p392',
      passenger_version => '3.0.19',
      www               => '/var/www',
      installdir        => '/usr/local/nginx',
   	  logdir            => '/usr/local/logs/nginx',
      extra_opts        => '--with-ipv6 --with-http_ssl_module',
      user              => 'www-data', # user owning www folder
    }
}
```

### Virtual Hosts

You can easily configure a virtual hosts. An example is:

```
nginx::vhost { 'www.example.com':
	port      => '8080',
	rails     => true,
  rails_env => 'production',
  root      => '/var/www/example',
}
```
The _rails_ attribute is optional and set to false by default. However, if you want to deploy a rails app, use this attribute and the rails template will be used instead.

### Supported systems

This module has been tested on:

  - Debian Squeeze 6.0.5, Puppet 3.1.0


For custom types, do not forget to enable pluginsync:

```
[main]
pluginsync = true

```
